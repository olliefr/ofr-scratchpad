## A whimsical list of pivotal points

* 2014 [Kubernetes]
* 2013 [Docker]
* 2010 Python [Flask]
* 2007 [Heroku]
* 2005 Python [Django]
* 1990 [Python]
---

* [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][CNCF]
* [Postman] is a collaboration platform for API development.
* [Serf] by [HashiCorp]&emsp;Decentralized Cluster Membership, Failure Detection, and Orchestration.

## Infrastructure

* [Amazon Web Services][AWS] (or [AWS]) provides computing instances and networking insfrastructure.
* [Google Cloud] is a direct competitor for [AWS].
* [Microsoft Azure][Azure] is also a competitor for [AWS] and [Google Cloud]
* [Joyent] provides managed private clouds, hosted or on-premise.
* [Alibaba Cloud] claims to have more users in Asia Pacific than any other Cloud platform
* [IBM Cloud] has _DB2_ databases and _Watson_ AI facilities easily accessible.
* [Oracle Cloud] presumably is good for ~~getting sued~~ Oracle database? They claim it's much less expensive than [AWS].

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* [Terraform] by [HashiCorp]
  Terraform allows infrastructure to be expressed as code in a simple, human readable language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). Terraform CLI reads configuration files and provides an execution plan of changes, which can be reviewed for safety and then applied and provisioned. Extensible providers allow Terraform to manage a broad range of resources, including hardware, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services.

* [Atlantis]. Pull request automation for [Terraform]

* [BOSH] by [Cloud Foundry]
  BOSH is a project that unifies release engineering, deployment, and lifecycle management of small and large-scale cloud software. BOSH can provision and deploy software over hundreds of VMs. It also performs monitoring, failure recovery, and software updates with zero-to-minimal downtime.

  While BOSH was developed to deploy Cloud Foundry PaaS, it can also be used to deploy almost any other software (Hadoop, for instance). BOSH is particularly well-suited for large distributed systems. In addition, BOSH supports multiple Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers like VMware vSphere, Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services EC2, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, and Alibaba Cloud. There is a Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) that enables users to extend BOSH to support additional IaaS providers such as Apache CloudStack and VirtualBox.

* [CloudFormation] Amazon [AWS]
  
  AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for you to model and provision AWS and third party application resources in your cloud environment. AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This gives you a single source of truth for your AWS and third party resources.

  In other words, it's *closed-source*, *vendor-specific* attempt at [Terraform].


## Key-value pair store

**!!!** Note how much of very advanced functionality is enabled by the *KV pair stores*

* [etcd]
    
  A distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system

* [Consul] by [HashiCorp]

  Consul is a service mesh solution providing a full featured control plane with service discovery, configuration, and segmentation functionality. Each of these features can be used individually as needed, or they can be used together to build a full service mesh. Consul requires a data plane and supports both a proxy and native integration model. Consul ships with a simple built-in proxy so that everything works out of the box, but also supports 3rd party proxy integrations such as Envoy.
    
  Other than providing a distributed key-value store, it also provides features like:
    
  * Service discovery (with DNS or HTTP) 
  * Health checks for services and nodes
  * Network infrastructure automation
  * Multi-platform service mesh

  [Consul] is built on top of [Serf]

 * [ZooKeeper] by Apache
    
   ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed.

## Network

* [OpenFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFlow) is a communications protocol that gives access to the forwarding plane of a network switch or router over the network. It is crucial to the whole *Software-Defined Networking* enterprise.

## Container orchestration

* [Docker Swarm] is a native container orchestration solution from [Docker, Inc][Docker].
* [Kubernetes] is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
* [k3s] is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances. Optimized for ARM.
* Apache [Mesos] is a *distributed systems kernel*. It allows to program against the datacenter like itâ€™s a single pool of resources (RAM, CPU, etc). It provides functionality that crosses between IaaS and PaaS.
    * D2iQ [MesoSphere] offers a commercial solution on top of Apache Mesos.
    * [DC/OS] (the Distributed Cloud Operating System) by D2iQ. They also provide a commercial version of it.
      is an open-source, distributed operating system based on the Apache [Mesos] distributed systems kernel. DC/OS manages multiple machines in the cloud or on-premises from a single interface; deploys containers, distributed services, and legacy applications into those machines; and provides networking, service discovery and resource management to keep the services running and communicating with each other.

    * [Marathon] is a production-grade container orchestration platform for DC/OS and Apache Mesos.
* [Nomad] by [HashiCorp] is a cluster manager and resource scheduler. It can manage containers, VMs, individual applications, etc...
* Amazon [ECS] elastic cloud service (not Kubernetes). Offers Fargate service which figures out the provisioning automatically, only container images have to be provided by the customer.

## Service discovery

* [Consul] by [HashiCorp]

## Hosted services and solutions

### Kubernetes

There is a notion of a *certified* hosted Kubernetes platform.

* [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (Amazon EKS)
* [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) (AKS)
* [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) (GKE)
* [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service/)
* [NetApp Project Astra](https://cloud.netapp.com/project-astra)

* [OpenShift] by [RedHat]
* [VMWare Tanzu Kubernetes Grid](https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid) (TKG)

## "*Cloud Native*"

In the *Cloud Native* approach, we design a package and run applications on top of our infrastructure (on-premise or cloud) using operations tools like containers, container orchestration, and services like continuous integration, logging, monitoring, etc. Kubernetes integrated with several tools meets our requirements to run *Cloud Native* applications.

[Draft vs Gitkube vs Helm vs Ksonnet vs Metaparticle vs Skaffold](https://hasura.io/blog/draft-vs-gitkube-vs-helm-vs-ksonnet-vs-metaparticle-vs-skaffold-f5aa9561f948/)

* [Helm]

  It is a popular package manager for Kubernetes. Helm packages Kubernetes applications into Charts, with all the artifacts, objects, and dependencies an entire application needs in order to successfully be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. Using Helm Charts, which are stored in repositories, we can share, install, upgrade, or rollback an application that was built to run on Kubernetes. Helm is a graduated project of [CNCF].
  
* [Draft]

  It is being promoted as a developer tool for cloud-native applications running on Kubernetes, and it allows for an application to be containerized and deployed on Kubernetes.
  
* [Skaffold]

  It is a tool from Google that helps us build, push, and deploy code to the Kubernetes cluster. It supports Helm, and it also provides building blocks and describes customizations for a CI/CD pipeline.
  
* [Argo]

  It is a container-native workflow engine for Kubernetes. Its use cases include running Machine Learning, Data Processing, and CI/CD tasks on Kubernetes.

* [Jenkins X]

  Jenkins is a very popular tool for CI/CD that can be used on Kubernetes as well. But the Jenkins team built a new cloud-native CI/CD tool, Jenkins X, from the ground up. The new tool leverages Docker, Draft, and Helm to deploy a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline directly on Kubernetes, by simplifying and automating full CI/CD pipelines. In addition, Jenkins X automates the preview of pull requests for fast feedback before changes are merged, and then it automates the environment management and the promotion of new application versions between different environments. Jenkins X is a graduated project of [CD Foundation].

* [Spinnaker]

  It is an open source multi-cloud continuous delivery platform from Netflix for releasing software changes with high velocity. It supports all the major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and OpenStack. It supports Kubernetes natively. Spinnaker is a graduated project of CD Foundation.

## REST APIs

* [Swagger] is an open-source software set of tools to design, build, document, and use RESTful web services, developed by [SmartBear Software]. It includes automated documentation, code generation, and test-case generation. 

## GitOps

* [Weave Flux] enables continuous delivery of container images, using version control for each step to ensure deployment is reproducible, auditable and revertible.
* [GitKube] is tool for building and deploying docker images on Kubernetes using `git push`.

  After a simple initial setup, users can simply keep git push-ing their repos to build and deploy docker images to Kubernetes automatically. It can be configured to update any k8s deployment with a newly built image using dockerfile present in the repo.
    
# Configuration Management

These tools allow us to define the desired state of the systems in an automated way. At any point in time, we want to have a consistent and desired state of systems and software installed on them. This is also referred to as *Infrastructure as Code (IaC)*.

* [Ansible]
* [Chef]
* [Puppet]
* [Salt]

Automated *image builders*:

* [Packer] by [HashiCorp]

## Monitoring and Security

* [DataDog] provides intelligent application and service monitoring, particularly suited for debugging microservices.
* [sysdig] scans for vulnerabilities and provides a view inside containers to alert on anomalous behavior and application health issues. It allows very rapid container and Kubernetes visibility and security onboarding.
* [Retrace] by [Stackify]
* [Vault] by HashiCorp (secrets management)
* [New Relic] observability platform
* [Sentinel]&emsp;_policy as code_ framework for [HashiCorp] Enterprise Products.

## Service Mesh

* [Consul] by [HashiCorp] is an open source project aiming to provide a secure multi-cloud service networking through automated network configuration and service discovery.
* [Tanzu] by [VMWare]

### Data Plane

* [Linkerd] is a [CNCF] project. It adds critical security, observability, and reliability features to your Kubernetes stackâ€”no code change required. Zero-trust multi-cluster Kubernetes. It can be installed *per host* or *instance*, as a **replacement for the sidecar deployment**.
* [NGINX]
* [HAProxy]
* [Envoy], a [CNCF] project. It can be set up as a *sidecar proxy* or as an *edge proxy*. **The most popular Serice Mesh proxy today.**
* [Traefik] from [Containous] is the Cloud Native Edge Router (ingress proxy).
* [Maesh] from [Containous] is a straight-forward, easy to configure, and non-invasive service mesh that allows visibility and management of the traffic flows inside any Kubernetes cluster.

### Control Plane

* [Istio] to connect, secure, control, and observe services. It uses an extended version of the [Envoy] proxy, deployed as *sidecars*.
* [Nelson] multi-cloud orchestrator (?)
* [SmartStack]
* [Kuma] is a [CNCF] project and is based on [Envoy]. It was originally created by [Kong]. Can be installed in a *universal* mode, or in a *Kubernetes* mode which injects a *proxy sidecar* into desired *Kubernetes Pods*.

## Algorithms

This is not a *vendor*, but I have no better place to record this for now.

* [Raft] *consensus algorithm* is used by *Docker Swarm Manager* nodes to maintain the cluster state.
