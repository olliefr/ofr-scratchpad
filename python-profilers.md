# Python profilers

Python Standard Library includes two *deterministic* profilers as described in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html).

I have also found [pprofile](https://pypi.org/project/pprofile/) to be useful. It can produce the output in [callgrind profile format](https://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-format.html). There is a good tool to visualise and explore this information, called [QCacheGrind](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qcachegrindwin/). It is a Windows build of a KDE tool [KCachegrind](https://kcachegrind.github.io/html/Home.html).
