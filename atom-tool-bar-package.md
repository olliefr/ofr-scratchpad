# Atom toolbar iconset location

The [Atom tool-bar package](https://github.com/suda/tool-bar) includes a number of iconsets. They are not necessarily the latest versions, so may not have the icons the latest versions have. It is, therefore, useful to be able to check *what's included* when looking for a suitable icon. 

The iconsets are stored in `~\.atom\packages\tool-bar\iconsets`.
