# Traceroute

A modern tool for network path analysis: SolarWinds [Traceroute NG](https://www.solarwinds.com/free-tools/traceroute-ng) for Windows.

Curiously, in Debian and Ubuntu Linux there is both `inetutils-traceroute` and `traceroute` which appear to be two historical implementations of the idea, each with their own pecularities. A quick search did not inspire confidence in their up-to-date-ness.
